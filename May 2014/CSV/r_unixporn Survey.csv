99% of posts are not porn worthy.

Installing a stupid bar and icon theme should not be considered as porn.
All i can fucking see is shitty Unity with fucking numix theme.

Mods sould start purging this place.

Also i fucking hate when someone post something and he doesnt include information about his config. And someone have to fukcing beg in comments for it.
Posts wihtout info in comments or in screens should be removed and baned, otherwise this idiots never learn.

I come here because i want see a fukcing advanced configs, workflow ideas, custom build features. Not a fukcing default KDE with shitty wallpaper and some fucking generic icon pack.

TLDR
1. removing posts wihtout information
2. removing generic default crap
3. start purging older shitty posts

I especially like the threads where users share scripts and configs from their setups. It really speaks to what free software is all about. I'm making the full switch to Linux in the next month and I can't wait to submit here when I get everything running the way I want it. 

If anything I guess some tutorials on desktop configuration would be cool, although I imagine you guys don't want to turn into /r/linux4noobs. 

Keep it real.

"2014/05/19 9:09:21 am CET","No","1","r/unixporn posts have been becoming less customised and more ""I installed Numix, it's shiny"" type posts. While these posts are nice, it's not what I expect to see when I visit the subreddit. Unfortunately this is a community issue and there's no easy way to change it; as a non-poster, mostly due to time constraints, I'm not really doing anything to change this myself, but making the community aware of this subreddit's culture might help. Maybe I have it wrong and these posts have a place here, but I'm not alone in my opinion and I have seen many other redditors making the same complaints.
Promoting the sharing of configuration files etc. related to screenshots via, say, GitHub would be really cool, but may also be outside of the scope of the sub. Unfortunately it has the potential to encourage the behaviour I reported above - posting stock, or close to stock screenshots of a DE or WM when there are already dozens of others just the same.
Ideally, this sub would feature refreshing content - not necessarily original, but unique in some way that shows the user has invested considerable effort in their setup. Regardless, I love this sub, so keep up the good work!","GNU/Linux","Arch","bspwm","No","No","No","Screenfetch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
