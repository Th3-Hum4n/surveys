# Responses to Survey Feedback

Here are the responses to the questions and feedback that was given in the not-suck survey. They're split up into the following categories of related questions:
* Bans
* IRC
* More
* Survey

Note your question might not be worded identically to how you asked it. These changes have been made just to make things more concise and easier to read.






## Bans
Every year people ask us to ban things, though this year it hasn't been as common.


> I'm tired of borderline pedophaelic anime wallpapers filling up 2/3 of the sub

Any content which is in the territory of paedophilia should be reported and will be removed. Other than in that case, we have no grounds to blanket ban anime posts.



> Perhaps slight updates should be banned as separate submissions? Seeing someone say: "I fixed a couple inconsistencies I missed" and doing nothing else, yet submiting a new post not one day later is annoying.

If someone has posted a duplicate setup like this then you can report it under the spam rules. We'll then verify whether or not it constitutes as spam and act accordingly.


> Ban Mac

As with all other systems, a default Mac system is against the no-default rule and will be removed. Why would we ban a customised OSX setup though?


> Ban screenshots of Chrom*

I can't tell if this is about Chrome/ium Browser or Chrom/ium OS, but either way it's a no.


> Ban WMs/DEs, DEs/WMs only!

Provided the screenshot is still sticking to the rules, there's no reason to ban one or the other and nor is there a reason they can't coexist in the same subreddit.


> Empty desktops are boring

They're also already banned! If you see a screenshot with no windows open it's breaking the rules, so report it!


> Remove all tags but screenshot and discussion

Got to say, you're the first peorson who's ever messaged saying that they want only screenshot and discussion posts. Needless to say this is some feedback we won't be acting on.



## IRC & Chat
These questions were on the topic of an official chat hub for the subreddit.

> Start an official IRC channel. I'm aware that in the past there was a disagreement among users, with some users being toxic, which resulted in the members of the channel dispersing, but if the information I've looked at is correct then it seems like it wasn't really moderated.

The demise of the IRC channel wasn't brought on through a lack of moderation: it had a rules page, multiple moderators, and a ban system all setup in place. A few abusive users just made it impossible to moderate to the same standard as the subreddit, causing endless complaints from those who went over to use it.


> If you guys are unsure regarding the matter, how about casting a vote where the users could decide if they think this would be a good idea?

We know for a fact that this is something the community want, but we also know from multiple attempts at making it happen that it's not something that will work out.


> Why don't you just promote ways of instant communication (IRC, discord) then?

We do! In the end we decided to disassociate ourselves from the channel at switch to keeping a [list of related channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/links/irc), the same as we do for other websites and subreddits. Making this include services other than IRC is a good idea, and definitely something we'll look at doing.



## More
Some people asked for more of a certain type of thing.


> Can we get more posts and users?

We're always looking for ways to increase the number of high quality posts in the sub, like competitions (which will be discussed elsewhere in this thread) and themes. If you have any ideas [drop us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Funixporn).



> More [type of post] posts!

The the change you want to see. Whenever something is posted it encourages people to post their things which are similar. That said, we are going to be putting in some effort to encourage the posting of  hardware and workflow since they're currently way underutilised.


> less unix, more porn

I have no idea what this even means.



## Survey
These were all suggestions made about the big annual system survey which we do every year.


> Can we have a longer time to respond? I missed it last time

We've had a fair few people say things to this effect throughout the year so the submission time has been extended from the previous 2 weeks to a month.


> Can we get correlation and more analysis in the results?

This is something I'd love to do if I had more time. Until then, all the results are [published on GitHub](https://github.com/unixporn/surveys) so you're welcome to look into it yourself.


> Can you implement a better voting system for deciding changes?

When we did the survey about what constituted a default setup it became apparent that using FPTP for everything wasn't working. The results were very messy and it was difficult to get anything meaningful out of them. I'm gonna try using a ranking system for some of the votes this survey, and we'll see how that pans out.


> More user submitted questions

Previously we asked for feedback during the subreddit survey which mace it difficult to incorporate user suggestions. This year we're trailing doing the Not-Suck survey first, and then the big system survey. Hopefully this will fix this problem.


> Can we get more info about the users? (e.g. age) Could be interesting.

That's a great idea, something I'll try and incorporate into this years survey.


> Ask what browser/text editor/bar/steam/other app people use

Software questions is something I'd meant to add last year but I forgot before publishing the survey. They're definitely going in this time, I promise!


> Maybe a question asking people how often they switch WM/DEs, if they're satisfied with their current one, which one they're thinking of moving to next?

This'll be a bit more difficult to seemlessly integrate, but I'll have a go. It might be worth just starting a thread about this kind of thing since it's more of a discussion topic than anything.


> Maybe ask how much custom stuff people roll with

This is already covered in our existing questions about theme elements, and we have a question which asks people to add anything else they'd like to share about their setup.


> The survey focuses on "what" but it would be interesting to have some "why"

That's a great idea, I'll try and add some of that in!
