"Start an official IRC channel. The rice community on IRC is so spread out, that it's almost non existent. I'm aware that in the past there was a disagreement among users, with some users being toxic, which resulted in the members of the channel dispersing, though if the information I've looked at is correct (I was not present, this opinion is based on observations of posts regarding the matter), then it seems like it wasn't really moderated. 

I understand that some users use various other IRC channels regarding ricing; however, they are quite small channels, or unmoderated. If this subreddit made its own official channel on IRC on a network like freenode or snoonet, then i can imagine that it would grow and become quickly active; uniting the rice community and further progressing in the process--given the amount of developers on IRC. If there was an official hub that was moderated well, it could be a really great thing.

A possible solution: Creating a Github reference repository for different window managers e.g. Xmonad, i3, BSPWM etc. with aleready riced configs and working for different distribution like Arch and Ubuntu. The clue would be: If the user wants to change something he will have to read the tutorials and will get interested to change more and more stuff.
