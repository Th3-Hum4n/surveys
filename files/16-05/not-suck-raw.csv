13/05/2016 05:10:14,"Start an official IRC channel. The rice community on IRC is so spread out, that it's almost non existent. I'm aware that in the past there was a disagreement among users, with some users being toxic, which resulted in the members of the channel dispersing, though if the information I've looked at is correct (I was not present, this opinion is based on observations of posts regarding the matter), then it seems like it wasn't really moderated. 

I understand that some users use various other IRC channels regarding ricing; however, they are quite small channels, or unmoderated. If this subreddit made its own official channel on IRC on a network like freenode or snoonet, then i can imagine that it would grow and become quickly active; uniting the rice community and further progressing in the process--given the amount of developers on IRC. If there was an official hub that was moderated well, it could be a really great thing.

If you guys are unsure regarding the matter, how about casting a vote where the users could decide if they think this would be a good idea?","I'm unsure about what survey you're referring to.

A possible solution: Creating a Github reference repository for different window managers e.g. Xmonad, i3, BSPWM etc. with aleready riced configs and working for different distribution like Arch and Ubuntu.

Discussion should require tags like ""Debate"" or ""Utility""(Like when the new neofetch is released). 
Continue with the way you've been moderating IE Interact with people, give reasons for your decisions, be open to critique, etc. These are all general things, I know, but until a specific event happens, it's difficult to predict how to control it. 

Maybe keep a list of ricing resources in the sidebar developed by members of this subreddit (or reddit in general). Neofetch was created by Dylan112, and i3-gaps is developed by airblader. I think a shout out to those who wish it would be nice and it would help further develop the community. 

On another note, maybe a weekly discussion thread on new/upcoming utilities where we can talk about that cool github project we found (related to ricing), and wonder if anyone else uses it/ has heard of it and can discuss it's merits, shortcomings etc. 

Some AMA's would be cool. I know  Dylan112 and Airblader are really approachable and helpful. But for some, a nice dedicated time to ask questions to creators of tools we love or that one guy with that REALLY awesome setup (you know the one that got XXX bajillion upvotes) might entice some of the subscribers who don't post much (due to either personal preference or simple fear of being new) to get involved, ask questions, and learn. 

Since we're talking about this stuff, I think it would be helpful in to wiki and on the sidebar to post a tidbit about the *nix philosophy. To really beat it into the skulls of the M$ people who are converting. ",Nope.,"Thanks for doing this. I mean this whole thing. The subreddit, your moderation, keeping the subreddit clean and healthy, being open to discussion and debate. Thanks. 
I've seen some heated debates, sure, but they're always quieted and have a good outcome. I really like that people are open about their dotfiles so we can all borrow snippets of each others config files, etc.
