# Results
We got 102 submissions for the 2018 Not-Suck survey! Below is a rough outline of improvements suggested for the subreddit and survey with the number of people who mentioned it in brackets. Generally just points which were brought up by two or more people are addressed here. The relevant points are also up for vote in the main survey.


## Subreddit
By far the biggest issue that people raised was dissatisfaction with the current quality of posts (16), and quite a few people said that we should transition to using a curated system (6). Others seemed to think that the issue was that our "defaults" rule isn't strict enough (4) or that our moderation generally isn't strict enough (3). A fair few people asked us to ban set-up elements like i3 which are really popular, though this idea hasn't been generally popular when we've asked in the past.

Some highlighted that our current system of flair filtering by post type sucks (3) and you might have noticed that this isn't something we've replicated for the Reddit redesign. If we do reimplement it there we'll look at improving it, and I might have a look what fixes can be made to the old design.

Only one person brought up that it's weird we give macOS a pass on the [OS] tag though that is something that people have brought up in the past too. Going forward if you're posting macOS you'll have to tag [Aqua]. I'm going to look into adding auto-removal for "first rice" type post titles too because that was also brought up as being annoying (3), most of the time inflating the amount of karma received.


## Survey
The most popular ask was that we added a question about terminal choice (6) which I will be doing. Otherwise I was reassured that most suggestions were only brought up by one or two people. I've picked a few from those that seemed interesting.

Something that someone brought up, and others too following the 2017 survey, was that it's in danger of becoming too long. To compensate for the few added I've removed, shortened, and merged a couple of questions to try and make sure we don't run into this. After 2018 concludes I'll chop a couple more which have the least interesting data.

Only 5 people mentioned moving to GitLab, though more than 100 upvoted a comment about it so it probably needs addressing. At least for now I'm not going to drop GitHub ([where our repos are](https://github.com/unixporn)) just because they've been acquired by Microsoft. That said, I have made [GitLab mirrors](https://gitlab.com/r_unixporn) of the main two repos (with more to follow) and I will switch us over if things go south.
