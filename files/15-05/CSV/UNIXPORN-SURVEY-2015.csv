I suggest putting more pressure on the community, documenting how they configured each part of the desktop. That way, noobs such as myself can create roughly the same experience, and then tweak to improve the experience for ourselves.

Anyway, fantastic moderation, and the mandatory comments with information+links to the content is fantastic.

One suggestion might be a title-generator (done in HTML+CSS+JS) that can create a title for /r/unixporn that can be either custom or a drop-down preset.

What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

I am being serious. Whenever I hear the words 'Linux User', I think of the most vommon user of the kernel, the Android user. In fact, I belive we should go for 'freedesktop', as many in  our community use BSD operating systems. Or, perhaps, we could even include the OSX snowflakes by simply saying 'Unix', however, this risks this subreddit to becoming primarily focused on Android, which would thus be included. However, the majority of the users of OSX who rice their desktops use a nested X server on top of quartz. X is a freedesktop project, and XQuartz itself is free. So, freedesktop would be the best term to use here. Not Linux, and not GNU/Linux.",,Yes,"Stock, I actually quite despise OSX.",No,,No,No,,,Android,No,Yes,,,FreeDos in a VM.,,,,,
