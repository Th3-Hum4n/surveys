"2018/01/11 11:24:53 am CET","sicnus#2831","EST","A Lot","You might call me the ""Grandfather"" of themes on Linux.  I founded Themes.org and Linux.com back in the day.  I've been quietly following /r/unixporn for a while and really enjoy it.  I can't promise to be a full ""hands-on"" mod, but I can offer advice on things as need be.  If not, I 100% understand.  Thanks for all you guys do for an awesome sub-reddit!"
"2018/01/11 11:26:23 am CET","Zyrophr#9068","UTC+01:00","Some","Why not, actually. I see a lot of peoples trolling each others or just talking about non-topic related things, or NSFW sometime posted. Plus, I think there is some lack of respect from some members.

So if you guys need any help, I would gladely accept to help you out !"
"2018/01/11 12:36:17 pm CET","Loki~ de Kismet ==‚ù§==#8126","GMT","Some","I did shitpost a lot, not so much anymore.
I've been quite active in the server for some time, helping others often when I ask. 
I'm friendly and people in the server seem to like me and the things I do. I'd like to use that to help keep things running smoothly as best I can. I've noticed people tend to fight the mods when it comes to rulings in the shitposting channel, hell I'm guilty of that myself, but I'd like to help rein that in. 

I've moderated in the past for a few gaming servers on Discord as well. Namely InukiTV, a server dedicated to the game SMITE."
"2018/01/11 1:12:17 pm CET","OTheB#2311","GMT","Some","I'm a mod on the Linux for All server and really enjoy it, and /r/unixporn is one of my favourite subs and I'd love the opportunity to be able to contribute more than just my mediocre rices. I don't see anything particular in the server that needs extra monitoring bar #tmp, but as said in the announcement, current moderation is thin, and I'm happy to help."
"2018/01/11 4:38:39 pm CET","Stnby#1264","UTC +2","A Lot","I'm interestd in helping to moderate this server because I like /r/unixporn community and I could moderate sensitive topics: political, racial, adult, etc."
"2018/01/12 9:38:39 pm CET","Lyze#3519","europe/vienna","A Lot","I think that the server is generally really well done right now, not a lot to monitor really since everyone is behaving well (lately at least).

But obvioulsy I'd keep an eye constantly on the chat when I'm available, which is most of the day. (From ~7:00-00:00).

I've also had a couple communites before (admin/mod/plugin dev. for various games, e.g. minecraft. Also was mod on 2 forums outside of gaming communities, and I'm also mod/admin in a couple other chats on irc, discord, skype, telegram.)

I'm personally a rather chill guy who doesn't get angry, swears or snaps at people."
