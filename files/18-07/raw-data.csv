The desktops featured here are consistently, utterly mindblowing. But I’ve struggled to implement anything close to unixporn on my own device. I think the wiki is a really wonderful idea, but a bit terse in its current state and (imho) slightly too abstract to be useful as a crash course, at least for this Linux noob. What I would really be grateful for is a step-by-step guide to reskinning one of the popular distros — starting with the default desktop, and speedwalking through a quick-and-dirty customization of whichever parameters are useful to be aware of. For example, I’m sure there’s a trick to tweak the window titlebar height in Gnome, but after scaling the font resolution for hidpi the titlebars are suddenly enormous. Like cartoonishly huge. I need to edit some CSS property of gtk, it looks like, but I’m still not sure how to inspect an element in electron, get the appropriate selectors, check what rules are currently being applied/from which stylesheets, etc., etc. A more detailed walkthrough would help me understand the process better so I’m not just googling one minor problem after another.",Yes,Ubuntu (inc. official variants),"Ease of use, Packages, Stability, Work","GNOME 3, Stumpwm (experimenting with it)","Customisation, Default, Ease of use, Tiling",Numix,No,"Fira, Input Mono",Concourse T3,No,"Chrome, Firefox",vim,Guake,zsh,Laptop,No,,No,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,Yes,iOS,No,,,No,,No,,ProbonoBonobo

But as proposed, I feel like most of the users here would take a hit. I like that people can use the sub to post WHATEVER their rice looks like, regardless of how you and I would rate it. Even if it's objectively bad, people still provide useful feedback and help others learn.

Seeing a list of beautiful themes is great, but think about how much innovation and trends come about by slight iterations on other peoples ideas, to create something new and original. Curating submissions turns this process from open source to closed source, which doesn't quite jive with the UNIX philosophy IMO.

I see curated content almost as the antithesis to limits on common posts. People who produce frequent, high quality content would (probably) only post content using a few specific types of setups. I like seeing the rarer, niche, and esoteric wm's on display here.

What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.","Yes, comments",No,No,No,No,Keep it the same,Make it stricter,Keep it the same,Support,Against,Indifferent,No,5,"No, Richard.",Yes,Void,"Customisation, Ease of use, Stability","i3, LXQt","Customisation, Lightweight, Tiling",Adwaita,No,Mononoki,"DejaVu, But I want to change it, I'm just started ricing my OS :)",Neofetch,Firefox,"vim, Kate","rxvt and friends, St",bash,Laptop,No,I'd just managed to make transparent bar using compton with Polybar and I'm glad of it :),No,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,Yes,Android,,Custom ROM,Customisation,No,,No,,mcjulcz

days that I get on and don't see lots of interesting or original posts. There
are however some really interesting posts that I've seen that use those common

interesting should be left to the upvotes/downvotes of the users.  I don't like
