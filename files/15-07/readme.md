In protest against the Reddit Admin's poor communication with mods a load of subreddits (default and otherwise) went private. This survey was to determine if /r/unixporn would do the same and the result seemed to indicate that we should. However, a lot of people also said that it should be up to the mods. As the only mod present @Foggalong decided not to go dark. This is the first and only time a survey has been done and then the opposite of the result being enacted.
