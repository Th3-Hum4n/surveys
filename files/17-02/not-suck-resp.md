# Responses

Thanks for everyone who answered [our call](https://redd.it/6f996h)! I was pleasantly surprised both by the variety of questions asked but also the overwhelming positivity about how things are going. I've answered below every question which had 2+ people asking it, as well as a few others. The number asking it is given in brackets.


## Content

> Make the wiki great! (14)

By far the most popular comment was that [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/index) is bad. And to be honest it is. How exactly we make it great is something we'll have to roundtable as a community.


> More contests! (11)

Contests is somewhere we've dropped the ball this year. We're going to try and address it over the year to come, starting with u/x_ero's [color contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/6feh1l/colorcontest_july_is_color_scheme_month/)!


> We need more variety in the content posted! (10)

Hopefully contests will contribute to dealing with this, but we've also had some great ideas from people that we'll look to doing too. Thanks to everyone who gave suggestions <3


> We need more of `$TYPE` type of content! (7)

Be the change you want to see. If you think we need more hardware posts, then post some hardware content!



## Rules & Modding

> Make people give more details (8)

A lot of you seem to think that the details comments we ask for aren't detailed enough. A few of you didn't even realise that we asked people to give a details comment (rule 5). We'll add a question to the survey asking what you think people should add.


> The defaults need to be stricter (4)

Last time we asked people about this they actually said they wanted it weaker than they already was. We'll ask again though this year in case anything has changed.


> The modding needs to be stricter/less-strict (3/1)

This is something we always ask about in the survey and the general trend is that we do a good job of getting the balance right.


> Make me a mod! (2)

The previous round of mod applications worked well so we're well stocked at the moment. We'll let y'all know though if we're ever in need again.



## Bans

So many of you wanted to ban a specific type of post, some in jest and others not. If we followed through with them all though we'd have no content! My favourite was the pair of people saying "Ban Arch" and "Ban everything except Arch".


> Ban `$POPULAR_THING`!! (12, various)

In the survey there will be a vote on having temporary bans on popular content. It's not been a popular idea when voted on in the past, but could have changed.


> Ban help posts (6+)

As a note we already disallow posts which are asking for help installing software. Last year we voted on if to further this and move all tech support questions to weekly help threads. The result never got enacted because of various sub kerfuffles, so we'll vote on it again this year.


> Ban Android (1+)

Someone suggested last time that we put a ban on Windows (including subsystems, VMs, cygwin, etc). The result never got enacted because of various sub kerfuffles. One person this year suggested something similar for Android, and it's a topic that's come up in the past. We'll be voting on both in the survey.



## CSS

> Can we have a better stylesheet than Naut? (5)

The Reddit admins are having a massive overhaul of how changing the look of a sub works. Their rough plan is to switch to a widget system and move CSS to an official tool, but with little support. It doesn't feel like a good use of time to do a complete change what we use when they could uproot it a few months down the line.


> Can we have a way to filter posts by WM/DE? (4)

We already do! It's not perfect, but [using Reddit's search function](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/6a4whs/kindle_debian_on_my_kindle/#link) set to "new" and "all time" manages this. This is why we have a rule that the [WM/DE] tag must be in the title.


> Support RES Night mode (2)

Proper r/naut Night Mode support is apparently coming in v4.1 which we'll get when we merge that into our version.


> Add a flair for `$DISTRO`! (2)

Comment on [this issue](https://github.com/unixporn/resources/issues/1) to have your distro added to the to-do list. If anyone fancies getting involved with making flairs then that repo is also the place to submit them to.



## Survey

Most of the survey suggestions were great! I'll be adding a lot of them in before it comes out on Sunday. There's a few that I'd like to respond to though.


> Look through all the answers!

I do! It's part of why it takes so long for the results to come out. Thank you for whoever sent the Papa John's discount code by the way, it was much appreciated.


> Ask more questions about mobile OS

Whenever we've done this in the past it's been a bit of a clusterfuck, but I'll try again this year.


> Use a FOSS survey host

If anyone has some recommendations for good FOSS survey hosts then do let me know. Google Forms has always proved easy in creation and exporting, but I'm open to moving elsewhere.


> What happened in 2016? Can you open source the results?

For the former [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/63iz9a/where_are_the_2016_survey_results/dfv01wu/). For the latter [see here](https://github.com/unixporn/surveys). In future if it looks like I won't be able to get the results out I'll push them there so that someone else can take them on.


## Misc.

> Scrap the approved hosts list

The approved hosts list goes a long way to ensuring that content posted will be available for years to come. For example, of the three hosts that people wanted adding last year, two have gone offline and the third has become invite only.


> Gild instructional posts

No? It'd be too expensive to do for them all, and if one makes it into the [Golden 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/info/goldenfive) then it already does get gilded. I also already spend money out of my own pocket to gild Golden 5 posts: $32 over the last year alone.


> You should make an official IRC channel!

Tried that, turns out IRC channels are quite difficult to moderate to a high standard. Instead we [matain a list](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/links/irc) of related channels.


> Why do you allow people to post Loli?

Loli is already banned in the sub. For more information as to why [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/info/faq#wiki_why_can.27t_a_post_screenshot_which_includes_loli.3F).
