What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.","No","No","No","No","Success","Success","Success","Success","Meh","Support","Indifferent","Indifferent","Support","Indifferent","Indifferent","Against","","","5","","Yes","Manjaro","cause im newbie","XFCE","Easy and lightweight (IT JUST WERKS)","Numix","Numix","Hack and Inconsolata","No","Neofetch","zsh","Chrome","Vim","Laptop","","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","","","","","","","Yes","7","GAYMES","No!","Yeah","Chrome","Vim","Desktop","","No","","","","","No","",""

So many posts, particularly lately, are XFCE+common theme (numix, arc, etc). Not to single out XFCE, I love it, but yeah just a lot of posts that seem to be someone just installing linux and applying the most popular theme, thinking it looks good, and posts it here. Again, definitely hard to draw a line though, even plain ""default"" looking posts might have something small that could be custom/unique/useful but could go unnoticed. Plus, even the most common themes/icons still look good and are nice to see, so it's hard to say which ones shouldn't be featured as much, they're obviously popular for a reason (arc, paper icons, etc.)","4","I think you guys are doing just about everything you can. It really comes down to what content is posted, and what gets upvoted. Obviously it's a lot of i3, bspwm and XFCE in particular. Lately a lot of ""OSX-like"" posts because of a popular osx arc theme or something. I dunno, it's hard to curate it, obviously you can't force users to use certain wm's or de's or themes etc. I dunno, I'm just rambling now, I have no answers... maybe just some way of promoting the exploration of other de's/wm's/themes and such, to avoid the ""cookie cutter"" content every day. More knowledge based posts that inform everyone of popular de's/wm's/themes/icons and such, or ones that aren't as popular but are up and coming, compatibility, etc. Or show resources for finding those things, like the AUR, or the arch wiki, or ways to setup certain environments, etc. Just more information out there to enable/urge users to try new stuff.

What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.","No","No","No","No","Success","Meh","Meh","Meh","Meh","Support","Support","Support","Support","Indifferent","Support","Support","wm config, if applicable","","4","I do enjoy browsing the sub, especially when there is variation, even if slight.
