Also on Firefox 30 on Mac, there is a bit of a glitch when I view comments. The top comment blends into the comment page sorting options and stuff. Here it is:

I don't see the glitch on chromium:

Also, I am a big fan of non-screenshot unix posts. I love the screenshots, but I think the occasional unixy post is a nice refresher. Also the comments on those posts tend to be interesting. (These kinds of posts are pretty consistently in the Top of All Time as well, which should be an indicator that they should not be banned).
